# Elastic Agent Setup Handover Document

## Overview
This document outlines the process of setting up the Elastic Agent in Docker containers, focusing on the differences between Ubuntu and Debian-based images, and includes a resolution for a common socket issue.

## Elastic Agent Configuration

### Configuration Template
Use the following template to generate the Elastic Agent configuration. This template uses environment variables for flexibility:
Refer to `render-config.sh`. this might be useful if get error on debian with command ./elastic-agent run > agent_debug.log 2>&1 &

## Socket Issue Resolution
We encountered an issue where the Elastic Agent was unable to create or access its socket file. This was resolved by ensuring the agent is running before attempting to enroll it. Here's the process:

1. Start the Elastic Agent in background mode:
This can be executed in any folder, say the extracted tar folder. Without this run step, you may face the .sock connection issue
   ```bash
   curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-${STACK_VERSION}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   tar xzvf elastic-agent-${STACK_VERSION}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   cd elastic-agent-${STACK_VERSION}-linux-x86_64   
   ./elastic-agent run > agent_debug.log 2>&1 &
   ```

2. Enroll the agent:
   ```bash
   ./elastic-agent enroll --url="https://fleet:8220" --enrollment-token="YOUR_TOKEN" --insecure -f
   ```

3. Verify the agent status:
   ```bash
   ./elastic-agent status
   ```

4. In debian VM, below commands will enable the service for start, and no need for container, which doesn't have `systemctl` and `systemd`
```
sudo systemctl enable elastic-agent 
sudo systemctl start elastic-agent
```

## Differences Between Ubuntu and Debian

### Ubuntu Setup
On Ubuntu-based containers, the setup process is generally straightforward:

1. Download and extract the Elastic Agent:
   ```bash
   curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-${STACK_VERSION}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   tar xzvf elastic-agent-${STACK_VERSION}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   cd elastic-agent-${STACK_VERSION}-linux-x86_64
   ```

2. Install and enroll the agent:
Below install command will copy all files including the symbolic link of elastic-agent to `/opt/Elastic/Agent` and start service from there.
   ```bash
   ./elastic-agent install --url=${FLEET_HOST} --enrollment-token=${ENROLLMENT_TOKEN}
   ```

### Key Differences
1. **Installation Method**: Ubuntu can use the `install` command, while Debian requires manual starting of the agent.
2. **Service Management**: Ubuntu can use systemd to manage the Elastic Agent service, while Debian requires manual process management.
3. **Enrollment Process**: In Debian, ensure the agent is running before enrollment. In Ubuntu, the installation process handles this.

## Best Practices
1. Always verify the agent status after setup.
2. Use environment variables for configuration to keep the Docker image immutable.
3. In Debian containers, consider creating a startup script that starts the agent and handles enrollment.
4. Regularly check the agent logs for any issues:
   ```bash
   tail -f ${ELASTIC_AGENT_PATH}/logs/elastic-agent-*.ndjson
   ```

## Troubleshooting
- If encountering socket issues, ensure the agent is running before enrollment.
- Check for proper permissions in the Elastic Agent directory.
- Verify network connectivity to Fleet and Elasticsearch servers.
- Review logs for detailed error messages.
