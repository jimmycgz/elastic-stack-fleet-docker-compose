### Key Achievements

1. Code is idempotent now
2. Fine tuning and fixing done
3. Molecule testing is working for ubuntu and debian (molecule.yml, prepare.yml and converge.yml)

## Next steps
verify.yml, last 2 tasks is not working properly, they are throwing elastic-agent is not working properly but i exec in both containers, I can see them working, need to fix that
