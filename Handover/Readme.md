## Current Status

I've successfully resolved the Molecule testing issues for the Elastic Agent Ansible role. The role can now be tested in a Docker environment that simulates the actual Elastic stack setup.

### Key Achievements

1. Fixed hostname resolution issues in the Molecule test environment. Refer details at `Handover/Resolve-DNS-containers.md`
2. Updated `molecule.yml` to use `extra_hosts` for adding Elastic stack service hostnames.
3. Ensured the Molecule test container can communicate with the pre-existing Elastic stack services in Docker.

## Recent Changes

1. Updated `molecule.yml`:
   - Added `extra_hosts` to resolve Elastic stack service hostnames.
   - Ensured the test container connects to the correct Docker network.

2. Modified the `converge.yml` playbook and `prepare.yml`:
   - Removed tasks that building dummy ELK
   - Removed dummy endpoints 

3. Updated the script for running Molecule tests:
   - Now uses `set -a` and `source` to load all variables from the `.env` file efficiently.
   ```
  # Render all viarables from .env

  echo $ES_URL
  set -a && source ../../../.env && set +a
  echo $ES_URL

   ```

## Current Configuration

The `molecule.yml` file now includes:

```yaml
platforms:
  - name: instance
    # ... (other settings)
    networks:
      - name: elastic-stack-fleet-docker-compose_default
    extra_hosts:
      - "elastic-stack-fleet-docker-compose-kib01-1:172.19.0.4"
      - "elastic-stack-fleet-docker-compose-es01-1:172.19.0.3"
      - "fleet:172.19.0.2"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive Testing and Finetune**: Run full suite of tests to ensure the role works as expected in various scenarios.

2. **Documentation**: Update the role's documentation to reflect recent changes and any new requirements for testing.

3. **Idempotency**: Ensure the role is fully idempotent by running it multiple times and verifying no unnecessary changes are made after the first run.

4. Test Debian by molecule

5. Low priority: Try to setup ELK from scratch by molecule, may leverage the docker compose config
