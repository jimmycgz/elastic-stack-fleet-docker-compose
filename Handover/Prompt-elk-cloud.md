Ch

@/ansible/ 
this folder has a role tested by both playbook and molecule target the same ELK stack built via docker compose on a CloudPC, how I need to tailor it to target a public ELK stack, please make it work.

to help you start, here's a code snippet to Get Enrollment Token 

The Basic auth doesn't work, use API KEY instead
```
curl -X GET "${ELK_KIBANA_HOST}/api/fleet/enrollment-api-keys" \
     -H "kbn-xsrf: true" \
     -H "Authorization: ApiKey $ELK_API" \
     -k

for your reference, the docker compose ELK stack is at @folder /Users/jimmy.cui/projects/ansible/elastic-stack-fleet-docker-compose/pre-stack
